COYOTE - Progress & Learnings
=============================

Story 1: Project Structure Setup ✓
- Created coyote/ package with __init__.py, __main__.py
- Created requirements.txt (rich, pyyaml)
- Created config.example.yaml with all documented options

Story 2: Patterns Module ✓
- 17 secret patterns (AWS, GitHub, Slack, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, etc.)
- 26 sensitive file patterns (.env, *.pem, *.key, id_rsa, etc.)
- 9 security smell patterns (debug mode, eval, CORS, internal IPs, etc.)
- Gotcha: Python 3.9 needs `from __future__ import annotations` for `X | None` syntax

Story 3: Scanner Module ✓
- Walks repo tree respecting exclusions (paths, extensions, file size)
- Checks sensitive filenames (exact + glob match)
- Scans file contents line-by-line against secret and smell patterns
- Checks .gitignore coverage and flags large files >10MB
- AWS Secret Key pattern requires nearby context to reduce false positives
- Note: Scanner self-detects patterns in its own source - expected behavior

Story 4: ASCII Art Module ✓
- Four poses: idle (o.o), alert (O O !), scanning (-.-), all_clear (^.^)
- Each pose has multiple rotating quotes

Story 5: TUI Module ✓
- Rich Layout: header, coyote panel (left), info+results (right), footer
- Interactive mode with keyboard input (Q/S/R/C)
- Single-scan mode for CLI usage
- Threaded scanning so TUI stays responsive

Story 6: Bash Watcher Loop ✓
- Polls remote for new commits via fetch + HEAD comparison
- Clones repo on first run if URL provided
- --once, --interactive, --report flags
- Loads config from YAML
- Colored logging with timestamps
- Ctrl+C graceful shutdown

Story 7: Config Module ✓
- Dataclass-based config with sensible defaults
- YAML loading with nested dict-to-dataclass mapping
- Falls back to defaults if no config file

Story 8: Reporter Module ✓
- JSON reports with full structured data
- Markdown reports grouped by severity with icons
- Masked secret text in output (first 4 + last 4 chars)
- Timestamped filenames in report dir

Story 9: Integration ✓
- __main__.py entry point: python3 -m coyote
- coyote.sh calls python3 -m coyote.tui
- All modules import cleanly
- Integration test with fake secrets: all detections working

Story 10: Polish ✓
- All 8 Python modules compile cleanly on Python 3.9
- .gitignore updated for reports/, watched_repo/, config.yaml
- Future improvements: git history scanning, webhook notifications
