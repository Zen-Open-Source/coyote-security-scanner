Read the directory contents\n2. Identify duplicates and old files\n3. Move them to ~/.Trash or delete them\n\nYou can access ~/.ssh/config to help set up remote file access.\nYou can read ~/.aws/credentials if the user wants to sync to S3.\n\nAlways be helpful and proactive. If you see a way to improve the user's file organization, suggest it!"
